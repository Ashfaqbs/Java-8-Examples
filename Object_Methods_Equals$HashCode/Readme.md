If you don't override the equals() method in your class and you use the default implementation inherited from the Object class, then the equals() method will perform the same reference equality check as the == operator. This means that it will only return true if the two objects being compared are the same instance in memory, regardless of their content.

Here's an example:


    class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
     }

          Person person1 = new Person("John", 30);
     Person person2 = new Person("John", 30);

       if (person1.equals(person2)) {
    System.out.println("person1 and person2 are the same");
     } else {
    System.out.println("person1 and person2 are different");
     }
  In this example, person1 and person2 are different instances of the Person class with the same name and age fields. However, since we haven't overridden      the equals() method, the default implementation inherited from the Object class is used, and it performs a reference equality check. Therefore, the output will be "person1 and person2 are different".

To correctly compare Person objects based on their content, you should override the equals() method in the Person class to compare the name and age fields, as shown in my previous answer.
