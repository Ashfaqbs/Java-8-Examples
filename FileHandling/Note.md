## This code can be used to read/write any file that contains text data, such as a plain text file (.txt), CSV file, XML file, JSON file, etc.

## However, if you want to read data from a file that contains binary data, such as an image file (.jpg, .png), audio file (.mp3, .wav), or video file (.mp4, .avi), you will need to use a different approach.

## To read binary data from a file, you can use the FileInputStream and BufferedInputStream classes, which read bytes from a file and buffer them in memory. You can then process the binary data using the appropriate classes for the data type you are reading.

### For example, to read an image file, you can use the ImageIO class in Java, which provides methods for reading and writing images. Here is an example of how you could read an image file using ImageIO


    import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
       import java.io.File;
       import javax.imageio.ImageIO;

    public class ImageInputExample {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("image.jpg");
            BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(file);
            System.out.println("Image dimensions: " + image.getWidth() + " x " + image.getHeight());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error reading image file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
     }


## In this example, we create a File object with the file name "image.jpg". We then use the ImageIO class to read the image file into a BufferedImage object. Finally, we print the dimensions of the image to the console.

## Similarly, for audio or video files, you can use libraries such as javax.sound.sampled or javax.media to read and process the binary data.
